# LIST OPERATIONS

# Containers

# a_list
# a_tuple
# a_set
# a_dictionary


# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "kiwi"]


# # Printing the second fruit
# print("Second fruit:", fruits[2])

# # Printing the third fruit
# print("Third fruit:", fruits[3])



# # Adding two more fruits to the end of the list

# fruits= ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape', 'kiwi', 'pineapple', 'strawberry']

# # remove the first fruit from the list

# fruits= ['apple', 'orange', 'grape', 'kiwi', 'pineapple', 'strawberry']

# print(fruits)




# TUPLE OPERATIONS

# Create a tuple with 3 country names 

# a_tuple= ("USA", "Japan", "France")

# print the second country in the tuple

# print(a_tuple[2])

# attempt to change the first country to germany

# a_tuple=["USA", "Germany", "France"]

# print(a_tuple)


# SET OPERATIONS

# create two sets:one with 3 prime numbers and another with 3 composite numbers

# a_set1={83, 89, 97}  
# a_set2={60,62, 63}


# Intersection of the two sets
# intersection_result = a_set1.intersection(a_set2)


# print("Intersection:", intersection_result)


# Union of the two sets
# union_result = a_set1.union(a_set2)


# print("Union:", union_result)


# DICTIONARY OPERATIONS

# Create a dictionary with 3 key value pairs representing fruits and their prices

# a_dictionary={"orange":"2","banana" :"3","apple" :"4"} 

# print(a_dictionary)

# add a new key value pair to the dictionary

# a_dictionary={"orange":"2","banana" :"3","apple" :"4" ,"kiwi" :"5"} 

# print(a_dictionary)


# Update the price of a fruit, for example, "orange" to a new price

# a_dictionary["orange"] = "8"

# print(a_dictionary)


# CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS

# create a variable num and assign it any integer value

# num=60

# write an if statement to check if num is even or odd and print the result

# if num % 2 == 0:
#     print(num, "is even")
# else:
#     print(num, "is odd")



# OPERATOR EXERCISES

# create two variables x and y and assign them integer values

# x= 90
# y= 30

# addition

# number_sum=(x+y)
 
# print(number_sum) 



# subtraction

# minus=(x-y)

# print(minus)



# multiplication

# multiply=(x*y)

# print(multiply) 


# division

# division=(x/y)

# print(division)


# remainder when x is divided by y

# remainder = 90 % 30
# print("Remainder when 90 is divided by 30:", remainder)


# x raised to the power of y

# result = 90 ** 30
# print(result)
